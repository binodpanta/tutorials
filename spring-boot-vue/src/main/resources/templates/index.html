    <h3 class="display-3">This is an example Vue.js application developed with Spring Boot</h3>
    <p class="lead">This file is rendered by a Spring built-in default controller for index.html (/) using
        Spring's built-in
        Thymeleaf templating engine. Although we don't need it per se, we customized the information passed to this
        view from thymeleaf by adding a controller method for "/" route to demonstrate how to pass information from
        Thymeleaf to this page.
        The combination of template engine and frontend framework like Vue can make this a powerful approach to build
        more complex applications while leveraging the benefits of a framework like Vue.js.
        You can use thymeleaf features too but this project focuses mainly on using Vue.js on the
        frontend as the framework and makes minimal use of Thymeleaf.
        Also we don't use any routing and multiple components in this example, so what you see is technically a
        Single Page Application (SPA) without any routes configured.
